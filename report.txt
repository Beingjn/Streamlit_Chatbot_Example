   • Both iOS and Android devices are affected, with reports of the casting process stalling or the projection failing to change even though the source shows as connected.
   • Laggy or “glitchy” connections are also mentioned, hindering a reliable mirroring experience.
Category: On/Off Issue

1. Inconsistent Power Activation (~70 reports)
   • Many customers describe the projector either not turning on at all or only powering up briefly (often showing the Aurzen logo) before immediately shutting off.
