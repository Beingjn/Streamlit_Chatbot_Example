Restarting both my computer and the projector.

I recently purchased a Boom 3 projector from Amazon and have come to two issues with the product. The first issue is when I initially set up the projector upon delivery, I was taken to the main screen already with the language set to French.

This leads me to believe that I¡¯m using a used product.This was not a deal breaker for me as I purchased this under the lighting deal price, assuming the projector were to work flawlessly.

AutoFocus is terrible auto never gets it right, manual focus is almost as bad, in that it does not cover the whole area, if the top is in focus the bottom isn't and vice versa, ( I guess that's why it's not recommended for use with power point, excel and word. 
manual focus always has to be used with the button on the remote, when displaying an input. 

Therre is no memory... the zoom is always wrong every time it's turned on 
It doesn't remember which input is in use and cannot auto detect a signal on HDMI 

and the worst; the display is dim, it is not half as bright as a projector with proper halogen lamp. In my opinion many of the claims made in the Advertisement on amazon are not met; for instance ""Vibrant colours and deep contrast. 

It may be ok if you are really close or want a small picture, but projected onto a 100"" screen it's rubbish. It is marginally better in a completely dark room. 

Auto power on doesn't work as it should in that when power is applied the screen does nor power on. 

It doeesn't connect to my Bluetooth speakers also would not connect for homeshare. 

USB input mode did not recognise my HDD with my movies on it. 

not being able to load your own streaming apps is disappointing and a major drawback to enjoying what one wants to watch. Prime and Yuotube are just riddled with Adverts and not worth watching. Netfix I not got it may be worth it 

the controls on the top of the proj are different (less) than on the remote. 

The manual seems pretty rudimentary, the little pictures for what is recommended and what is not are hard to interpret and there is no explanation of CEC mode funcitons(that is how it is spelt lol) or what PC mode does 

The power supply lead is too short for ceiling mounting as most UK mains power point are low on the wall also not the power connector on the projector is 5.5x2.5mm so a standard 5.5x2.1 will not fit.

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing to report an issue with the projector I purchased from your company in November of last year. Unfortunately, the device has developed a significant malfunction, and I am seeking assistance under the warranty.
The problem manifests as follows:
	1.	Upon powering on, the projected image is extremely dim and flickers.
	2.	The cooling fans slow down unexpectedly.
	3.	The image disappears completely after a short time.
	4.	After connecting to a Bluetooth device, tÝîûB.©

Since this issue was present from the moment I turned on the projector, I suspect it may be a manufacturing defect. I would like to request a resolution, whether it be a repair, replacement, or refund. Please advise on the next steps I should take to resolve this issue.
I can provided photos of the problem in different focus. Please let me know how to proceed.

I bought my Aurzen Boom 3 projector in June 2024. I was very satisfied with it since then, but for two weeks, nothing has been going well. It turned on alone one night, the sound of the engine woke me up and I closed it, but since then, a stain appears permanently on the screen.

It is not supposed to be this way, as it is like, suddenly the connection becomes like an HDMI Arc instead of just need to output video. This might be the issue.?

Is there anyway I can troubleshoot this or try further. Its getting frustrating.?

Dear?Aurzen Customer Service Team,
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request assistance with a warranty claim for my [Projector Model and Serial Number], which I purchased on [Purchase Date] from Amazon Aurzen Official Store.
Unfortunately, the projector has been experiencing intermittent power failures, where projector would not turn on occasionally. Also have display issues where my image on the screen appears yellowing or burned like color. I have attempted basic troubleshooting steps as?outlined in the user manual, but the problem persists.
The product is still within the warranty period, and I have attached the following documents to assist in processing my claim:
	?	Proof of purchase (e.g., receipt or invoice)
	?	Warranty documentation
	?	Photographs or videos illustrating the issue?
Please let me know if you require any additional information or further steps from my side. I would appreciate guidance on how to proceed with the repair or replacement process.

Auf der Suche nach einem g¨¹nstigen Beamer mit anst?ndigem Bild und leisem L¨¹fter habe ich mir nach und nach sechs verschiedene Modelle bestellt, manche davon sind komplett f¨¹r die Tonne, andere halbwegs zu gebrauchen.

Ich habe ¨¹ber Amazon einen Beamer gekauft.?
Bestellnummer:?304-2479417-2831541
Nach den ersten Einstellungen hat alles super funktioniert. Als ich ihn dann das erste mal so richtig ausprobieren wollte, hat er leider nicht mehr fokussiert.?
Ich habe ihn an derselben Stelle stehen wie auch beim erstmaligen Einrichten (da hat er noch automatisch fokussiert).?
Ich habe ihn nun schon mehrmals versucht manuell zu fokussieren, aber auch dies funktioniert nicht. Auch auf die Werkseinstellung zur¨¹ckzusetzen hat ebenfalls nicht geholfen.
Ich bin ratlos und m?chte Sie um Hilfe bitten.?
K?nnen Sie mir bitte den Beamer kostenfrei ersetzen (auch wenn der Zeitraum der kostenfreien Retoure schon abgelaufen ist)?
Danke f¨¹r Ihre R¨¹ckmeldung.

Rezension aus Deutschland vom 3. April 2025
Farbe: SchwarzVerifizierter Kauf
Der AURZEN Boom 3 Beamer klang in der Produktbeschreibung wie ein echtes Highlight: 4K-Unterst¨¹tzung, offizielles Netflix, 3D Dolby Audio, Autofokus, HDR10, 60Hz, WiFi6 und Bluetooth. Leider stellte sich schnell heraus, dass das Ger?t in der Praxis weit hinter den Erwartungen zur¨¹ckbleibt. Trotz der vielen beworbenen Features leidet der Beamer unter schwacher Bildqualit?t, unzuverl?ssiger Software und einer entt?uschenden Helligkeit, die ihn f¨¹r viele Einsatzzwecke ungeeignet macht.

Mangelhafte Bildqualit?t und schwache Helligkeit
Eines der gr??ten Probleme des Beamers ist die unzureichende Helligkeit. Selbst in einem abgedunkelten Raum wirkt das Bild blass und kontrastarm. Die beworbenen HDR10-F?higkeiten sind kaum erkennbar, da dunkle Szenen oft zu dunkel und helle Bereiche ausgewaschen wirken. Besonders ?rgerlich: Die 4K-Unterst¨¹tzung ist kein echt","The AURZEN Boom 3 projector fails to meet expectations with poor image quality, weak brightness, unreliable software, and unsatisfactory performance of advertised features like 4K support and HDR10.",TRUE,"['Display Issue', 'Software Issue', 'Specification Mismatch']"

Positive Aspekte:
1. Der Beamer startet sehr schnell und ist in k¨¹rzester Zeit einsatzbereit.
2. Der integrierte Autofokus ist eine tolle Funktion und funktioniert zuverl?ssig.
3. Die Bildqualit?t ist in dieser Preisklasse wirklich sehr gut.
4. Die Lautsprecher sind deutlich besser als bei meinem vorherigen Beamer, k?nnten aber f¨¹r ein wirklich immersives Klangerlebnis noch etwas verbessert werden.
Negative Aspekte:
1. Der eingebaute L¨¹fter ist ziemlich laut, was auf Dauer etwas st?rend sein kann.
2. Bereits nach dem dritten Einschalten ist mir ein Pixelfehler aufgefallen, der besonders bei dunklen Szenen sichtbar ist. Auch nach dem Reinigen der Linse blieb das Problem bestehen, also scheint der Staub bereits im Ger?t zu sein, ohne dass man es einfach reinigen kann ¨C und das ist sehr nervig.

Ten¨ªa el proyector: AURZEN EazzeD1. Sinceramente se ve¨ªa perfecto, calidad de imagen, brillo, los colores eran s¨²per intensos y facil¨ªsimo de usar, para mi una compra 10!.
Pero a los 6 meses ha dejado de funcionar: no se enciende y hace ruidos. Lo he devuelto y ning¨²n problema me han devuelto el dinero. Compr¨¦ hace unas semanas este proyector de la misma marca aurzen Boom 3 ya que es m¨¢s caro y parec¨ªa que ten¨ªa muy buenas rese?as y te¨®rica mejor calidad en todo. Lo ¨²nico que si funciona mejor es el sistema de altavoces que superan al anterior. Pero la imagen no me gusta (no es del todo mala) pero si que los colores son mucho menos intensos que los del otro proyector que he comentado.

I recently purchased the?EAZZE D1 Pro Smart Projector on Amazon. I have LOVED this projector. I¡¯ve only had it for 4-5 months and suddenly the projector powers on but no light projects.?
It wasn¡¯t a gradual or slowly degrading ?loss of light, and I can¡¯t seem to figure out how to fix it. I tried all the picture settings to increase brightness but it doesn¡¯t help. I also tried a reset in the settings. Is there something I may be missing that could have caused the problem? I take excellent care of the unit. Would be pretty upsetting to have to replace the whole unit in such little time of ownership. Please help!

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the return and refund process for the Aurzen D1 Pro projector I purchased.

Could you kindly provide the following information:
1. The steps I need to follow to return the projector.
2. Any required documentation or forms needed for the return process.

First the good stuff. The 720p picture is perfectly adequate, and looks better than some cheap 720p tv's on the market. 100 ANSI lumens of brightness is good for around 26"" of screen in dim light, and much bigger in a dark room. The speakers are surprisingly good for their size, and the autofocus is fast and accurate. 
Unfortunately, after spending the day with it, I've discovered some really irritating flaws, which totally flattened my initial excitement. 
The brightness and picture quality are really good for a unit of this size, but there is dust and/or micro-scratches on the lens and on the inside of the lens cover. A clean lens is arguably the single most important thing on a projector, so dust/damage in such a critical area raises questions over how well built the unit really is. 
The keystone correction is annoying as well. I appreciate that there's a limit to how much you can pack into a unit this size, but its size is its biggest enemy here. It automatically squares the screen up (and it does a pretty good job of it), but a unit this size and style will ALWAYS be shooting at an upward angle, and it doesn't correct the screen ratio. This means that everything you watch will be stretched vertically (standard 16:9 videos typically end up stretched closer to 4:3), and there's nothing you can do about it. If 4 point keystone is too much to ask from a tiny unit, I feel like recognising the issue and giving me the option to manually crop the screen height would be a fairly simple workaround. 
There's a lot to like about this projector, and as a showy development piece it's a marvel, but it's entered the market priced pretty close to one of the market leaders in compact projectors, so I expected it to be a LOT more polished than this.","The customer is impressed by the projector's compact size, decent picture quality, and sound, but is disappointed by dust or scratches on the lens and limitations with the keystone correction causing distorted screen ratios.",TRUE,"['Other Hardware Issue', 'Specification Mismatch']"

I purchased the EAZZE D1 projector a few months ago, and while it has only been lightly used, it has now completely stopped working. The projector was working fine the last time I used it, but after sitting unused for about two weeks, it no longer powers on properly.

The light near power button still turns on, which confirms that it is receiving power, but the screen stays completely black. I have tried all troubleshooting steps, including:
Using different power outlets
Holding the power button for reset
Despite all this, the projector still does not display anything.

Given that the product is only a few months old and has been gently used, I¡¯m disappointed by this sudden failure. I would like to request your assistance ¡ª whether that be a replacement, repair, or further support instructions.

Now, I am realistic. I have reviewed over 100 projectors. All of them different types and sizes and I understand limitations. 

This one I wasn't expecting fantastic, but I was hoping for usability. 

First off, there was absolutely no way to plug in a Roku or Fire stick (or HDMI for that matter.) No inputs. Yep, you read that correctly, no inputs. I honestly don't know how much room it would take to put an HDMI input in, but it can't be so much that it would ruin the portability function of this. Disappointing. 

If I am casting to this, I am probably watching a movie. However, since many services (Max, some Prime, etc.) don't allow you to cast a movie, you are out of luck. 

So what am I using this for? Probably business meetings if I need several people to see a spreadsheet or PowerPoint. That's fine and dandy, except your room needs to be completely dark because it isn't that bright. I would expect that, except I can't cast a movie so what else am I using it for? 

Finally the battery. Not long enough for a movie, well, I guess we eliminated them anyway didn't we? The battery should always last 2 hours. I didn't get near that point. I got a solid hour out of mine. 

The audio isn't great which is to be expected. 

I guess, overall, what's the purpose? What am I supposed to do with this? Not bright enough to use in meetings, can't stream movies from most providers to this, and the battery isn't big enough if I was. 

I did rate it three stars because it does work and there might be a niche use you have for it. But buyer beware and figure out your need before purchasing. 

Overall, it does work, just make sure it will do what you want. 

To the designer - add an HDMI port and give me two hours on the batter. Oh my goodness what a difference that would make! It would be 5 stars for sure.

I have acquired a?Aurzen ZIP Tri-Fold Projector from Kickstarter / Pledgebox?and received it successfully. Sadly, on my third use of the projector, it broke down.
The idea is that I have bought the projector for its portability and form factor, intending to use it while on holiday, travelling with my two kids, for some evening kids movies or cartoons while abroad.
Sadly, I could only use the projector three times in total:
- first, shortly after receiving it, on 28 March 2025 for watching a half an hour movie with the kids;
- second, somewhere mid april 2025 when some friends wanted to see it, just short, for about 15 min.;
- third and final time, on wednesday 23 april 2025, on its first intended use, I was on a holiday with my family and in the evening I used it for a Cartoon movie for my kids. Sadly, after about 25 min. of watching, it started suddenly to flicker, artefacts appeared on?the projection and then, after another 12-20 sec. it rebooted by itself.","The projector broke down after only three uses, flickering and showing artefacts before rebooting unexpectedly during its first intended holiday use.",TRUE,['Other Hardware Issue']

Unfortunately, the projector has stopped functioning properly after 4 months of use and despite following all troubleshooting steps outlined in the manual, the issue persists : Power is on but no image / video displayed anymore, after several attempts, unusable.

As the product should still be under warranty, I kindly request that you repair or replace the defective item, or issue a refund if neither option is available. I have attached a copy of the invoice for your reference and videos.?

The screen kept telling me it was displaying at 1080p but the quality was not there. I grabbed a screenshot from my LG OLED TV to compare and I can see that the colors on the projector are duller, washed out, and not as crisp. It looks like I am watching an old CRT TV. I am using a white projector screen and I also tried watching at night. Same results. I even went into settings to see if I could adjust the brightness, contrast, HUE, sharpness, etc. No difference. 

I was able to get the Google Home app set up after a little frustration. I could not find the QR code to scan. There are so many QR codes on the various boxes and documentation and none of them was the correct code. I think I finally used Google Nest or partner device to find the projector. It is not in the list of Matter-enabled devices. Once I added the device I was easily able to set up Wi-fi. You can also use voice control if you select it. 

On the positive side I did like having access to my apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Peacock, YouTube, etc. Also there is an HDMI input, 2 USB-A, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and you can use Google Cast. I like that the projector automatically focuses and refocuses if you move it. Also the Keystone correction and option to choose if the projector is ceiling mounted, floor mounted, or desk mounted. The speakers provide decent sound but you can connect to any Bluetooth speakers for additional sound options and the 3.5mm headphone jack. 

The biggest consideration in purchasing this projector is what do you plan on viewing and where you plan on viewing it.

My son and I both agreed that it would be watchable for basic programming during the day depending on where you were projecting it. The last two photos and the video were taken in our basement rec room and in total darkness. As you can see, it looks very nice with nice colors and good saturation. The remote is fairly easy to use but at times it takes a second push of a button to get it to respond but I don't know if that is simply a directional issue or something else. So with those points made, I want to state why I only gave it three stars. The first is the one that I have stated over and over and that is the price. At this cost you can actually go find an actual TV that would outperform it in every category. The colors are nice and clear but a 4k tv is going to produce richer colors with less washout in any lighting situation. Secondly, if you need a projector for some specific spot, there are ones out there that are much cheaper and will give you about the same image quality - I know this for a fact because we have a couple that we use for outdoor family events. Some of those projectors don't have as nice sound however with Bluetooth or other sound outputs available, it doesn't really matter. And frankly, while the sound is pretty good for such a small unit, if you are having movie night with this projector, you will be adding an external audio source because its not that good. So, if you take price out of the equation or if that isn't a factor for you, then this is a pretty good projector.",The customer finds the projector good in performance but feels the price is too high compared to alternatives like TVs or cheaper projectors with similar quality; the remote occasionally requires multiple presses to respond.,TRUE,"['Specification Mismatch', 'Other Hardware Issue']"

Always responsive, remote worked when i was aiming it to where the beamer was projecting and the beamer was very fast with processing everything. But now the remote only works when i precisely aim at the beamer and still then it only works half the time and the beamer has become half as fast as it was in the beginning. And I know that over time things become slower but in two weeks half the processing speed as when i just got it is crazy. I have put new battery's in the remote i have had the beamer plugged out for a whole day but nothing helped. So i wanted to ask if you could help me couse this is just not working how it should.

Well made. Packaging is awesome. Sounds is pretty good though I can't expect it as good as Bose. For me I am good with it without need a soundbar. Built-in OS so it is a plus, no need to plug in any Chromecast or like that. But there are several downsides that I don't like. 

No official Disney and Hulu apps. Only webview apps, which make the experience and loading performance terrible. Several times the on/off button on the remote doesn't do anything and require me to unplug the power cord to shutdown the projector. The display is not bright enough. You will need a total darkness in your room so you can enjoy the most. I found several dead pixels upon receiving the package and turn it on. Don't think the lens sealed in a dustproof enclosure as I can see dust starting to grow difusely over time on the display.

I hope you¡¯re doing well.
I purchased the Aurzen projector from your store on Amazon on January 24, 2025, and it has worked well until recently. Now, when I turn it on, the fan runs continuously, but there is no display¡ªnot even the usual white startup screen.
I¡¯ve already tried cleaning the lens carefully, but it did not fix the issue. The projector simply turns on with the fan running, but no image or light appears on the screen.
Since it¡¯s still within the one-year period, I believe it should be covered under warranty. I¡¯ve attached or can provide my Amazon order receipt as proof of purchase.
Please let me know how I can proceed to get a repair or replacement for the unit.
Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response.
Best regards,
Chinedu Anyanebechi

I purchased an Aurzen projector in December 2024.

My name is Ramona Dorina Vetisan, and I am contacting you regarding a defective Aurzen EAZZE D1 projector purchased via your official Amazon store. The order was placed on 04.11.2024, with invoice number DS-AEU-INV-AT-2024-17471465.
Shipping and billing address: Oberaffnang 5, 4674 Gaspoltshofen, Austria.
After only a few months of normal use, the projector has developed a critical brightness issue (photo attached), rendering it unusable. I have tested all possible settings and environment conditions, and it appears to be a hardware failure.
Warranty Rights Under EU Law:
I would like to formally initiate a warranty claim under the EU-wide 2-year legal guarantee (Directive 1999/44/EC and current Austrian consumer protection law).
Please note:
I am not required to return the original packaging to claim this right.
I am not obligated to have registered the product with any email.

I purchased the Aurzen BOOM 3 projector on February 10, 2025 and was initially very satisfied with the video and sound quality.
However, over the past few weeks, I have noticed that the cooling fan has become increasingly loud during operation, to the point where it is now very distracting, especially when watching videos. This was not the case when I first started using the device, and the noise level has clearly worsened over time.
If this issue is a general problem with this model series, I kindly request a full refund. If, however, this is an isolated case affecting only my unit, I would appreciate a prompt exchange and the provision of a fully functional replacement device.
Please review my concern and inform me about the next steps at your earliest convenience. Thank you in advance for your understanding and support.
